Abstract:
PepsiCo is one of the largest food and beverage companies globally, and analyzing its stock price trends is crucial for investors and market analysts. This study presents an exploration of historical price patterns, volatility, and trends using advanced forecasting models. I applied multiple time series analysis techniques, including ARIMA, SARIMA, ETS, and machine learning models such as XGBoost and SVM, to accurately predict PepsiCoâ€™s stock price. Through rigorous model evaluation and validation, the final models show high accuracy in predicting future stock prices.

Key Topics Covered:
Understanding Returns and Volatility: How these metrics impact investor decisions and stock price movement.
Comprehensive Time Series Analysis: Decomposing time series, residual analysis, variance stabilization.
Advanced Modeling Techniques: ARIMA, SARIMA, ETS, TBATS, and ensemble methods to capture patterns in stock price data.
Machine Learning for Forecasting: Implementation of XGBoost and SVM using ensemble methods for enhanced accuracy.
Forecasting Results and Accuracy: Detailed evaluation metrics and validation on test data to ensure robustness.

ðŸ“… Future Stock Price Predictions (2026):
Based on the models, PepsiCoâ€™s stock price is expected to follow a moderate upward trend over the next two years. Investors can expect stability in stock price growth with slight fluctuations due to market volatility.
