Abstract:
PepsiCo is one of the largest food and beverage companies globally, and analyzing its stock price trends is crucial for investors and market analysts. This study presents an exploration of historical price patterns, volatility, and trends using advanced forecasting models. I applied multiple time series analysis techniques, including ARIMA, SARIMA, ETS, and machine learning models such as XGBoost and SVM, to accurately predict PepsiCo’s stock price. Through rigorous model evaluation and validation, the final models show high accuracy in predicting future stock prices.

For Investors and Analysts: If you're a financial investor or anyone interested in stock market trends, this study delves into:

Key Topics Covered:
