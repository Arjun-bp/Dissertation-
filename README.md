"PepsiCo Stock Price Prediction Using Time Series and Machine Learning Models"

This project involved an in-depth analysis of PepsiCo's stock price to identify historical trends and forecast future performance. The key components of my research include:

Understanding Returns and Volatility: I examined how these metrics influence investor behavior and stock price movements.
Comprehensive Time Series Analysis: I employed methods such as decomposition, residual analysis, and variance stabilization to analyze the stock price data effectively.
Advanced Modeling Techniques: I utilized traditional models like ARIMA and SARIMA, along with advanced machine learning methods such as XGBoost and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to capture intricate patterns in the data.
Forecasting and Validation: The final models were rigorously evaluated for accuracy and robustness, with future stock price predictions made for the next two years (up to 2026).

My research contributes valuable insights for investors and analysts looking to understand and predict stock price behavior in the financial markets.
